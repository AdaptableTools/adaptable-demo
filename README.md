# adaptableblotter-demo
Repository for the Adaptable Blotter demo application which showcases the powerful data-agnostic HTML5 AdaptableBlotter.JS grid.

AdaptableBlotter.JS offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality. It also provides unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital for the current regulatory and compliance environment.

This demo shows AdaptableBlotter.JS using 2 underlying grid controls –Telerik's Kendo Grid (a commercial licenced product) and OpenFin's Hypergrid (an open-source grid).  The blotters are using purely dummy data, included simply for demo purposes.

Adaptable Blotter licences are free for development use, but a paid-for annual end user licence is required for each production user. 

Further information about AdaptableBlotter.JS, and full Help, is available at www.adaptabletools.com.
