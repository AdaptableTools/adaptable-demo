# adaptableblotter-demo
Repository for the Adaptable Blotter demo application which showcases the powerful data-agnostic HTML5 AdaptableBlotter.JS grid.

AdaptableBlotter.JS offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality. It also provides unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital for the current regulatory and compliance environment.

This demo shows AdaptableBlotter.JS using 3 underlying grid controls –Telerik's Kendo Grid (a commercial licenced product), OpenFin's Hypergrid (an open-source grid) and the ag-Grid (the latter in both grouped and non-grouped mode).  The blotters are using purely dummy data, included simply for demo purposes.

Adaptable Blotter licences are free for development use (and include both the .NET and .JS versions), but a paid-for annual end user licence is required for each production user. 

Further information about AdaptableBlotter.JS, and full Help, is available at www.adaptabletools.com.
