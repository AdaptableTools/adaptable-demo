Repository for a demo that showcases AdapTable - the powerful, market-leading data manipulation tool.

You can run AdapTable with a number of different dummy data sets.

## AdapTable

AdapTable is a powerful HTML5 DataGrid add-on that integrates with the leading datagrid components and provides all the additional, rich functionality that financial and other advanced users expect from their grids and blotters.

It offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality. It also provides unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital in the current regulatory and compliance environment. Try it out for yourself at https://demo.adaptableblotter.com.

More grid components are being added all the time so contact us if you would like us to implement your favourite HTML5 grid control.

AdapTable is fully data agnostic and can work with any data set you provide it with. It is suitable for all data, all asset classes, all grid types, all locations and all use cases.
